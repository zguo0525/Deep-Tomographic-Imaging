# Deep-Tomographic-Imaging

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks, python libraries, and information needed to reproduce "Deep Tomographic Imaging for 3D Objects".

The git repository contains all the code needed, however there is also a substantial amount of data associated with this work which cannot be distributed via a git repository. The data can be found by request to the author. The code in this repository assumes that the data has been downloaded and located in a folder placed in the top-level directory within the repository.
